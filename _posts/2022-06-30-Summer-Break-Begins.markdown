Today is the official end of Grade 11 and the start of summmer. I have a lot of projects in mind in order to build my portfolio. One project is the twin DRSSTC project. Last summer, I built one DRSSTC from scratch, which was a great learning experience. This summer, I want to work on an improved twin setup for polyphony playback.
