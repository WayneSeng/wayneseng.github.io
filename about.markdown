title: About
---

My name is Wayne Zeng and I am a grade 11 high school student at St John's
School. I am a computer and electronics enthusiast. Outside of school
projects, I work on personal projects that connect to electronics and/or
programming. I enjoy solving real world problems and making the quality of
life for those around me easier. I am a dedicated, hard working person
that will do whatever it takes to understand a concept or to solve a
problem. Finally, I am a big advocate for right to repair, ensuring less
e-waste is sent to our landfills.
