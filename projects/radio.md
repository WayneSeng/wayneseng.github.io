Sometime around March of 2022, I watched a video by Samy Kamkar about radio hacking. He was able to unlock vehicles and garage doors using software defined radios connected to a laptop. I was instantly hooked and this was when I started the radio hobby. When I was experimenting around with 433mHz transmitters, I was curious on what other radio transmissions are around us. I know law enforcement and first responders use radios in order to communicate with one another efficiently. I now wanted to listen in and see whats on the radio spectrum.

This is where the software defined radio came into the picture, specifically the RTL-SDR Blog V3. I found this device after searching online for the best software defined radios as well as watching a couple of YouTube videos. I chose the RTL-SDR Blog V3 because it had the most features for the price, which was extremely competitive and affordable.

 This SDR can receive frequencies from 500kHz to 1.75GHz. Especially for this price, it is a great deal. I decided to buy the RTL SDR bundle for 55 CAD, which comes with everything you need to get started since I didn't have any antenna hardware. This kit comes with a dipole antenna with a tripod and other mounting hardware.
